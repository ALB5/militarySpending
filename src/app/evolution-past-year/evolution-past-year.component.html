      <p><span>Latvia</span> ranks first. It increased its spendings as it considers itself under the threat of Russia. The same explanation applies for <span>Lithunia</span>.</p>
      <p>For <span>Botswana</span>, it seems a bit surprising, as the country is in a zone where there is no current conflict or direct threat. Nevertheless, the government engaged in a modernization programme.</p>
      <p>The rise of the military budget in the <span>Philippines</span> aims at boosting its fight against Islamist groups and reinforce maritime security in the disputed South China Sea.</p>
      <p>As for <span>Mali</span>, it pursues its effort to fight the Islamist extremist threat.</p>
