  "readme": "# Lato Font\n\n[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/lato-font.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/lato-font)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lato-font.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/lato-font)\n\nThis is the latest official `2.015` web-version of the OpenSource [Lato font][lato]\nsuitable to be used with [npm][npm] or [Bower][bower].\n\n> Support for legacy EOT and TTF font types are dropped in version `3.0.0`.\n> If you need this for [old devices](http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff), please use the version `2.0.0`.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- latest official web-optimized version of the *Lato* font\n- supports all unicode ranges (i.e. languages), variants and styles provided by *Lato* font\n- provides both *CSS* and *SCSS* (*SASS/Compass*) integration options\n- installs with *Bower* and *npm*\n- individual fonts can be added to a project using [*SCSS* integration][scss-api]\n- all fonts can be added to a project just by including provided CSS-file\n- library is extremely customizable and provides very convenient [*SCSS* API][scss-api]\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install library with *npm*\n\n`npm i -D lato-font`\n\n### Install library with *Bower*\n\n`bower install --save-dev lato-font`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nEither [link library directly via *CSS*][css-integration] or use provided [SCSS API][scss-api] in your build process.\n\nBy using [*SCSS* API][scss-api] you can easily add individual fonts to your project!\n\n\n### Hint\n\n*Medium* versions of *Lato* font (both regular and italic) are available under the `Lato Medium` name instead of just `Lato`.\nThis is required because *Medium* and *Normal* variants are using the same weight of `400`.\n*CSS* only supports values divisible by `100` for the `font-weight` property.\n\n\n### CSS integration\n\nJust link provided CSS file to your page:\n\n`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/bower_components/lato-font/css/lato-font.css\">`\n\nThen use provided font-faces it in your CSS:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  font-family: Lato;\n  font-weight: 900;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n\np.quote {\n  font-family: \"Lato Medium\";\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n```\n\n\n### SCSS API\n\nThe best way to use this font library is by integration with *SCSS* (*SASS/Compass*).\n\nConsider this example:\n\n```scss\n\n@import 'public-api';\n\n$lato-font-path: '/bower_component/lato-font/fonts';\n\n@include lato-include-font('black');\n@include lato-include-font('medium');\n\nh1 {\n    @include lato-font('black');\n}\n\np.quote {\n    @include lato-font('medium', italic);\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can see the list of available mixins in `/scss/public/_mixins.scss`.\n\nList of available variants is in `/scss/internal/_variables.scss`.\n\nYou can override font path directory using `$lato-font-path` variable.\n\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have found a bug or have another issue with the library - please [create an issue][new-issue] in this GitHub repository.\n\nIf you have a question - file it with [StackOverflow][so-ask] and send me a\nlink to [s.fomin@betsol.ru][email]. I will be glad to help.\nAlso, please create a [plunk][plunker] to demonstrate the issue, if appropriate.\n\nHave any ideas or propositions? Feel free to contact me by [E-Mail address][email].\n\nCheers!\n\n---\n\n\n## Licenses\n\n### Library\n\n    The MIT License (MIT)\n    \n    Copyright (c) 2014 Slava Fomin II\n    \n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n    \n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n    \n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The\n    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \n    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\n    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\n    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n    \n    DEFINITIONS\n    \"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\n    Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may\n    include source files, build scripts and documentation.\n    \n    \"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\n    copyright statement(s).\n    \n    \"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\n    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n    \n    \"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\n    or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\n    Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\n    new environment.\n    \n    \"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\n    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n    \n    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\n    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\n    Software, subject to the following conditions:\n    \n    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\n    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n    \n    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\n    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\n    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\n    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n    \n    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n    presented to the users.\n    \n    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n    Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n    permission.\n    \n    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n    distributed under any other license.
